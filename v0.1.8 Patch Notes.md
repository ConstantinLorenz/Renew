- Added default messages for:
    - Italiano
    - Deutsch
    - French
    - Espaniol

- Added support for Dark Mode Icons and Banner Images
- Unified and clarified various exit codes

    - Some Display sleep assertions are ignored by default, and a future release will allow.
     - Default ignored assertions:
        - Amphetamine
        - caffeinate
        - obs

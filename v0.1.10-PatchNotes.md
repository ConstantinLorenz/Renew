### Renew.sh v0.1.10 - Patch Notes
- Fixed dialogExitCode variable typo
- Removed `-o` flag from dialog command, resulting in default SwiftDialog behavior that windows cannot be moved.
- Added additional configuration keys for:
    - AdditionalNormalOptions
    - AdditionalAggressiveOptions
    - AdditionalNotificationOptions
    - NotificationSubtitle
- Added --defer5 and --defer10 command line arguments for testing. Set a deferral a 5 or 10 minutes in the future and exit.
- Added `ShowDeferralCount` Optional Argument.
  - Default messaging behavior changed. The "deferrals remaining" language is not included by default
  - Set this key to boolean <true/> to show the "deferrals remaining" language in Normal Mode events
- Added `Deadline` Optional Argument. Use this to set an uptime deadline of \<integer\> days and if your uptime exceeds this you get Aggressive Mode messages.
- Added the ability to disable `MaximumDeferrals` by setting to `-1`
- Added the ability to disable `NotificationThreshold` by setting to `-1`
